January 2022 was a month of gathering momentum and taking the first steps towards leveling up in 2022. I always feel very energized when the new year comes around, but this year I couldn't help but notice that the beginning of 2022 felt like a continuation of 2021 (which felt like a continuation of 2020). It's been almost 2 full years since pre-pandemic life, which is an unfamiliar concept at this point... I have a hard time even remembering what pre-pandemic life was like. I think this foreign feeling is also partly due to the fact that I feel like a completely different person from pre-pandemic Victor, which I think is a reassuring feeling because it indicates that I've grown over the past 2 years.

This month started off with a week back in Pittsburgh with family and friends. I got to spend time with family and catch-up with high school friends who were also back in town. In Week 2, I got to celebrate a friend's long-awaited 21st birthday with Whirlyball and karaoke. This also turned out to be a great time to see other friends I hadn't seen in a while. MLK weekend was spent exploring Los Angeles with frisbee friends eating yummy food and desserts, hitting up the beach, and visiting super aesthetic museums. Week 3 was spent settling back into my Fort Worth apartment and organizing my life aka buying groceries, meal prepping, doing laundry and cleaning, etc. Week 4 was spent creating this personal website v3 and updating my resume and LinkedIn profiles. I also got to see Tom Segura live with some friends.
