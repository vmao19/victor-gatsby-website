April 2022 was the start of a new chapter. I moved from Fort Worth, TX to San Francisco, CA and submitted my 2-weeks notice for my current job. The move across the country was a road trip with my friend to several National Parks. Once in SF, we took time to settle in, explore the city, and meet old and new friends in the area. We also took a spontaneous roommate trip to Coachella 2022 W2, which was a blast. Once again, I am forever grateful for friends and being able to spend time with genuinely good and caring people.

This month started off with final moving preparations while spending a few days at my brother's place. Then, my friend and I left FW on 4/9/21 and made it to SF on 4/13/21. On the way, we visited White Sands NP, PistachioLand, Flagstaff, Grand Canyon NP, Zion NP, Las Vegas, and Sequoia NP. The second weekend in April was my first weekend in SF and was spent picking up apartment essentials from Facebook Marketplace, meeting old and new friends in the city, and hitting up the beach in Half Moon Bay. The third week was dedicated to prepping and sending Coachella, which we decided to go to just 6 days prior as a spontaneous roommate trip. We were able get GA 3-day bands from friends and scrape together a crew and gear for camping. Coachella was a whirlwind. The trip started off with us almost missing our flight down to LA at 5:30am in the morning. When we arrived in LA, we picked up our friend's car and another friend, headed 2 hours east to the desert, set up camp, met the neighbors, and began the weekend of fun. In three days of music, camping, and art, we saw sets by Flume, Disclosure, Rich Brian, Louis the Child, Maggie Rogers, Billie Eilish, The Weeknd, Swedish House Mafia, Baby Keem, Slander, and more! It was the biggest music festival I had ever attended. After returning that weekend, the fourth week was spent recovering, continuing to settle in, and ending the month climbing at Pacific Pipes and eating yummy dim sum at Ming's Tasty, both in Oakland.
