June 2022 was spent finishing up travels, starting my new job, and hosting friends. 

The first week of June was spent wrapping up the California road trip with high school friends. On the first day, we left Channel Islands NP and drove to Santa Monica where we celebrated a friend's birthday at a fancy restaurant. Then we visited Joshua Tree NP for a night and continued to San Diego. Finally on the 5th, I ran the San Diego Rock n' Roll Marathon. I ran it with two other high school friends, one of which who also ran the marathon and the other who ran the half marathon. I felt great for the entire first half but hit the wall around mile 16. At mile 22 there was a brutal mile-long stretch of steep uphill but I found my friends cheering me on at the top of the hill which was extremely heartwarming. I spent the second week of June, unpacking, running errands, and getting my life sorted out. That second weekend, I attended my cousin's graduation at Stanford. The third week was my first week of work! I met the team, learned about the company, and spent time setting up development environment and watching onboarding videos. Weekend three was spent meeting friends in SF for dancing, Corgi Con, and dinner. Week four was spent hosting a friend from college and eating at lot of different restaurants like Boiling Hot Pot (AYCE) and Mourad (Michelin 1 Star). Week five was spent hosting two other good college friends and another friend and exploring SF together.
