February 2022 was a month of pushing through the fading motivation and novelty of the New Year. When this happens, it is important to fall back to self-discipline and just do the things that need to be done. I struggled with self-discipline in February which led to a lot of procrastination. This is definitely something I can get better at through repetition and eventually it'll become part of my identity. This will be one of my focuses for March.

This month started off with Lunar New Year and exploring job postings, job boards, and job applications. In Week 2, I got to meet some new people for the first time while in Fort Worth and also attended my friends' House Warming Party. In Week 3, my out-of-town highschool friend visited over the President's Day Weekend and we explored the DFW area and ate at so many good spots (Velvet Taco, Delucca Gaucho, Terry Black's BBQ, Joe T Garcia's). We also ordered our first bottle of (more) expensive wine - Caymus 2019, which made me realize that the hype of (more) expensive wines is actually justified. We all tasted a significant increase in quality and flavor from the average $15 bottle wine. In Week 4, I ran the Cowtown Half Marathon and ended up with an official time of 2:00:28. The race atmosphere was electric and it was even better to be able to complete it with a group of friends.
