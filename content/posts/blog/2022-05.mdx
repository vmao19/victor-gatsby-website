May 2022 was spent traveling and exploring, both in SF and in places away from SF. I balanced this with the conclusion of my first job at Charles Schwab and the start of a 3-week hiatus in-between jobs. I also got to spend 2 weeks back in Pittsburgh with my family.

The first week of May was highlighted by a visit from a college friend, in which we got to explore SF! We ate at Daeho, played Spikeball on the beach, watched Everything Everywhere All At Once, and visited some breweries. After my friend left, we also successfully hung up the TV, watched the final Warriors and Grizzlies game at Chase Center, and started drafting posts to build my IG profile. In the second week, I returned to Pittsburgh to stay with my parents. This week was spent working from home, hanging out with my parents in the evening, and increasing my running mileage in preparation for the marathon. The third week in May was my last week at Charles Schwab. It was also the week my brother also returned to Pittsburgh for the summer. This week was spent handing off my project at work, more family time, more running preparation (I ran 35 miles this week including a 19 mile run), and packing to return to SF. When I returned to SF in the fourth week, it was time for a big California roadtrip that we had been planning for months. 5 of my high school friends flew into SF, where we spent a day exploring SF, a day in Napa Valley, and began our roadtrip journey down south to San Diego. We spent the last day of May hiking and camping on Channel Islands National Park.
