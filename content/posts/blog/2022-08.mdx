August 2022 started off with a bang and then calmed down as I settled into a slower life routine focused on fitness, work, and open weekends. 

The first week in August was the lead up to the first weekend which was very eventful. For the first weekend in August, my high school friend visited SF and we explored SF on Saturday. Then Saturday night, we hosted a party at an SF nightclub in celebration for one of my roommate's birthday with 40+ friends. We started on the rooftop and headed down into the venue until quite late. Then Sunday, in the morning we went on an adventure and successfully found my friend's lost phone from the night prior, got dim sum from Chinatown for lunch, and sent it to Outside Lands music festival in GGP. We saw artists like Briston Maroney, Forester, Surf Mesa, Mt. Joy, and Illenium. The second week and weekend in August was spent at work, working out, getting my flat tire fixed, and on Sunday I went to a daytime pool party for Sam Feldt (and Justin Ward) with some friends. Week three was highlighted by the company hackathon, which was a fun 24-hour event where we got to work on different, innovative projects at work. There were many exciting activities, such as a lunch event, a trivia competition, a relay race, and a scavenger hunt. Weekend three was spent running errands, getting goodies from H-Mart, and exploring Soma and Mission with the neighbors. Week four was focused on fitness where I attended the company bootcamp workouts during lunch for the first time. Weekend four was spent relaxing at home, reflecting on the summer, and setting goals for the rest of 2022.
