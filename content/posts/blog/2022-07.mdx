July 2022 was a go go go month with something planned every weekend. I spent a lot of quality time with friends, both in SF and away from SF.

The first weekend of July was spent in Colorado with college friends for a friend's bachelor party. We celebrated our friend who's getting married in October, played a lot of Spikeball, and hiked to and swam in a mountain lake. After returning from Colorado, the first week of July was spent working, getting used to a full house as we were hosting two friends all of July, and prepping for more friends who were visiting. The second weekend and week was spent hosting and taking two more friends around SF. We went toured the city in a yellow go-cart, attended a Sean Kingston concert, went to the beach and on a 5-mile hike, ate at Ox 9 Lanzhou Noodles (delicious), and hit up Wasabi Bistro's $10 all-you-can drink special. This went straight into the third weekend of July which was spent in Dallas. I took the red-eye Friday night into Saturday morning and took the DART into downtown Dallas, where I met up with college friends, including a college friend who visiting from Kenya. On Saturday, we played Spikeball, ate Mike's Chicken, went to a brewery, ate at Terry Black's BBQ, and got ice cream at Jenni's. Then we had a Sunday brunch, went to a friend's pool party, met two other friends for lunch and ice cream, and got dropped back off at the airport. While it was only 36 hours in Dallas, it was heartwarming to be able to see all my friends and spend quality time with them catching-up. The third week in July, I attended a Top Golf work function, we posted our first posts to @BaeHouseSF on Instagram, and prepped for another weekend away from SF. The fourth weekend was spent at Yosemite, where we got an eerie experience with smokey air and ash snowflakes. On Sunday, half of us woke up at 2:45am to pack down camp and hike Yosemite's Half Dome. Starting at 4:45am, we pushed very hard on the way up, reaching the top around 9am. After spending some time at the top, we took more time to descend and even swam in Emerald Pool on the way down. We arrived at the bottom around 5pm and started the journey home. The last week in July included another work function at Sandbox VR and more chores and errands. Finally, the last weekend in July was spent exploring the city with our July housemate who was leaving. We went to the Oakland Museum of California, the de Young museum, SF's GGP Japanese Tea Gardens, Crissy Beach, and Lombard Street.
