March 2022 was the month I turned 24 and executed on big plans. Several things came together very nicely to open up the next chapter of my life. I believe it's a testament to being able to achieve anything and everything you desire if you put in the work. I was also able to go on a 2 trips with friends with lots of new experiences. I am forever grateful for friends and being able to spend time with genuinely good and caring people.

This month started off with a weekend in Austin with some college friends. We saw Ronny Chieng's sold-out comedy show, ate a lot of yummy food, and enjoyed Zilker Park. In Week 2, I did my taxes, continued grinding, and went on a Dallas photoshoot with friends. In Week 3, I took some vacation time and went on an adventurous Colorado trip with friends. We saw Madeon in Denver and did a lot of activities for the first time, like hiking icy mountains, snowboarding, visiting hot springs, climbing 1 mile of steps, and mountain biking. It was truly a memorable trip. In Week 4, I started packing my belongings and selling furniture on Facebook Marketplace to move out of my apartment.
