## Goal ##

Update my personal portfolio website again, this time using Gatsby.

## Description ##

Jan 2022: Updated my personal website from an Angular frontend hosted on an Apache2 Webserver on my Raspberry Pi to a Gastby website deployed to the Gatsby Cloud.

Over winter break, I was going through some React tutorials and discovered Gatsby. I was impressed by Gatsby's speed and versatility, plethora of starter templates, and the large library of plugins. 

This website is based off of the [minimal-blog starter](https://github.com/LekoArts/gatsby-starter-minimal-blog) by [LekoArts](https://github.com/LekoArts). 

Here are some Gatsby plugins that caught my eye:
* [gatsby-source-filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-filesystem) - I saw that it was easy to add posts and pages via using the gatsby-source-filesystem. A simple GitHub commit would automatically generate url routes and pages.
* [gatsby-transforer-remark](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-remark) - I implemented Markdown rendering in my v2 Angular website, so this plugin would make it easy to transfer my project content to the new site.
* [gatsby-transfomer-sharp](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-transformer-sharp) - Responsive image resizing was an issue in my first two personal websites and something I never got around to fixing. This plugin would do the work for me.
