👋 Hi!

I'm Victor Mao and welcome to my website! I'm a 23 year-old Software Engineer at Charles Schwab. I like to play Ultimate Frisbee 🥏 and read 📖. I am currently learning photography 📷 and how to DJ 🎧.

I was born in Omaha, NE and grew up in Pittsburgh, PA.

I graduated from [UT-Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu/) with a B.S. Computer Science in 2019 and a M.S. Information Technology and Management in 2020. At UT-Dallas, I was heavily involved with [WOOF](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1wEbWkqKfymrD0IqdXv5w) - the Men's Club Ultimate Frisbee Team, and was a Physics Peer Tutor for 2 years.

I am currently located in Fort Worth, TX 🤠.
